GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime environment for executing those queries by using a type system you define for your data. It enables clients to request only the data they need from the server and nothing more, allowing for more efficient data fetching. GraphQL provides a single endpoint for fetching data, which contrasts with traditional REST APIs that have multiple endpoints for different resources.

Apollo is a set of tools and libraries for building GraphQL applications. It includes client-side libraries for JavaScript frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue.js, as well as server-side libraries for Node.js. Apollo Client is a popular library for managing GraphQL state and data fetching in client-side applications, while Apollo Server is used to create GraphQL APIs on the server-side. Apollo simplifies the process of working with GraphQL by providing intuitive APIs and features like caching, local state management, and subscription support.
